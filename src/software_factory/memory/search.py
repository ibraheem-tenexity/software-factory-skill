"""SOF-38 (T4.1): hybrid dense + tsvector search over `chunk`, fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion —
project-memory-integration.md §2. Dense (pgvector cosine `<=>`) and keyword (Postgres native
`tsvector`/`ts_rank_cd`) channels are each capped at `_CHANNEL_LIMIT`, then combined by RRF
(`1/(_RRF_K + rank)` per channel, summed) so a passage strong in either channel — not just both —
surfaces. No reranker/contextual-retrieval prepend/learned-sparse here; those are deferred per the
ticket's own scope.

Written as a single SELECT with subqueries in FROM, not a `WITH` CTE: `PgConn.execute()`
(dbshim.py) decides whether to fetch rows by checking `head.startswith("SELECT")` — a
`WITH ...` CTE query fails that check and silently returns zero rows every time (confirmed by
reading dbshim.py; no existing caller uses a CTE, so this never surfaced before). Subqueries in
FROM are equivalent for a query with no recursion, and this avoids touching dbshim.py at all.

`dense <=> ?::vector` — the explicit cast is required (found against a real seeded DB, review
by y96ilz0o): a bare `?` binds the query vector as a generic param with no column-type context,
and Postgres has no `vector <=> double precision[]` operator, so the comparison raises
`UndefinedFunction` at runtime. An INSERT into a `vector` column gets pgvector's assignment cast
automatically; a raw operator comparison like this one does not — first time this codebase has
done the latter.
